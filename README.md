This folder contains a series of VB scripts I created for intelligently sorting, collating and removing duplicates from a series of huge datasets of more than 4,000 contacts in XLSM spreadsheets.

The scripts were created as Excel macros in VB for Applications.

Folder also includes an XLSM I created for collating availability from a raw data export from the company's booking system (Class For Windows), which includes multiple VB scripts as macros.
